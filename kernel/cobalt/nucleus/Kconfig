config XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	bool "Extra scheduling classes"
	default n
	help

	Xenomai implements a set of scheduling classes.  Each
	scheduling class defines its own set of rules for determining
	when and how to select a new thread to run.

	The Xenomai core has a built-in real-time class, which
	supports both preemptive fixed- priority FIFO scheduling, and
	round-robin scheduling.

	Enabling this option will allow you to select additional
	scheduling classes to compile in.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP
	bool "Temporal partitioning"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help

	This option enables support for temporal partitioning.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP_NRPART
	int "Number of partitions"
	default 4
	range 1 1024
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_TP
	help

	Define here the maximum number of temporal partitions the TP
	scheduler may have to handle.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC
	bool "Sporadic scheduling"
	default n
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_CLASSES
	help

	This option enables support for the sporadic scheduling.  It
	can be used to enforce a capped limit on the execution time of
	a thread within a given period of time.

	If in doubt, say N.

config XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC_MAXREPL
	int "Maximum number of pending replenishments"
	default 8
	range 4 16
	depends on XENO_OPT_SCHED_SPORADIC
	help

	For performance reason, the budget replenishment information
	is statically stored on a per-thread basis. This parameter
	defines the maximum number of replenishment requests that can
	be pending concurrently for any given thread that undergoes
	sporadic scheduling (system minimum is 4).

config XENO_OPT_STATS
	bool "Statistics collection"
	depends on XENO_OPT_VFILE
	default y
	help

	This option causes the real-time nucleus to collect various
	per-thread runtime statistics, which are accessible through
	the /proc/xenomai/sched/stat interface.

config XENO_OPT_SHIRQ
	bool "Shared interrupts"
	help

	Enables support for both level- and edge-triggered shared
	interrupts, so that multiple real-time interrupt handlers
	are allowed to control dedicated hardware devices which are
	configured to share the same interrupt line.

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_PERIODIC
	bool "Tick-based timing"
	help

	Xenomai allows different skins to be clocked separately,
	according to distinct frequencies, or aperiodically. In the
	periodic case, delays and timeouts are given in counts of
	ticks, which duration can be fixed by configuration or set
	at runtime. In the aperiodic case, timings are directly
	specified in nanoseconds. Selecting this option allows you to
	run skins depending on a periodic time base.

	You can leave this option disabled in order to save a few
	hundreds bytes and some cycles on the fast path if you plan to
	use the system timer in tick-less (i.e. aperiodic) mode only.

	This option must not be confused with the ability to run
	periodic threads, which is possible is both timing
	modes. Periodic threads needing high timing accuracy will even
	likely prefer using aperiodic timing.

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_VIRTICK
	int "Virtual tick duration in aperiodic mode (us)"
	default 1000
	help

	Time-slicing (aka round-robin scheduling) defines a base
	period that represents the duration of one tick; threads can
	then be given a time credit to consume as a count of
	ticks. For that reason, time-slicing is usually based on a
	periodic timing mode.

	This parameter defines the duration of a virtual tick
	expressed as a count of micro-seconds, so that time-slicing is
	also available to threads that undergo aperiodic timing. In
	such a case, the time credit assigned to a thread will be
	equal to XENO_OPT_TIMING_VIRTICK * quantum, where quantum is
	the count of ticks representing a full time-slice.

config XENO_OPT_TIMING_SCHEDLAT
	int "Scheduling latency (ns)"
	default 0
	help
	Scheduling latency is the time between the termination of an
	interrupt handler and the execution of the first instruction
	of the real-time thread this handler resumes. A default value
	of 0 (recommended) will cause a pre-calibrated value to be
	used.

config XENO_OPT_SCALABLE_SCHED
	bool "O(1) scheduler"
	help

	This option causes a multi-level priority queue to be
	used in the real-time thread scheduler, so that it operates
	in constant-time regardless of the number of _concurrently
	runnable_ threads (which might be much lower than the total
	number of active threads).

	Its use is recommended for large multi-threaded systems
	involving more than 10 of such threads; otherwise, the default
	linear method usually performs better with lower memory
	footprints.

choice
	prompt "Timer indexing method"
	default XENO_OPT_TIMER_LIST
	help

	This option allows to select the underlying data structure
	which is going to be used for ordering the outstanding
	software timers managed by the nucleus when operating in
	aperiodic timing mode. In periodic mode, a fast timer wheel
	data structure is always used, regardless of this option.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_LIST
	bool "Linear"
	help

	Use a linked list. Albeit O(N), this simple data structure is
	particularly efficient when only a few timers (< 10) may be
	concurrently outstanding at any point in time.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_HEAP
	bool "Tree"
	help

	Use a binary heap. This data structure is efficient when a
	high number of software timers may be concurrently
	outstanding at any point in time.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_WHEEL
	bool "Hash"
	help

	Use a hash table. Timers operations using this data structure
	should have an O(1) complexity if the timers follow two 
	conditions:
	- timers expiration dates do not collide too much;
	- there is at least one periodic timer using a period near
	the wheel step (around 100000 ns by default).

endchoice

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_HEAP_CAPACITY
	int "Binary heap capacity"
	depends on XENO_OPT_TIMER_HEAP
	default 256
	help

	Set the maximum number of timers in the nucleus timers list.

config XENO_OPT_TIMER_WHEEL_STEP
	int "Timer wheel step"
	depends on XENO_OPT_TIMER_WHEEL
	default 100000
	help

	Set the duration in ns of a timer wheel step. At each step, 
	the timer wheel use the next hash bucket.

config XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV
	int "Number of pipe devices"
	depends on XENO_OPT_PIPE
	default 32
	help

	Message pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication
	channels allowing data exchange between real-time kernel
	threads and regular user-space processes. Pipes natively
	preserve message boundaries, but can also be used in byte
	streaming mode from kernel to user-space.

	This option sets the maximum number of pipe devices supported
	in the system. Pipe devices are named /dev/rtpN where N is a
	device minor number ranging from 0 to XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV - 1.

config XENO_OPT_REGISTRY_NRSLOTS
	int "Number of registry slots"
	default 512
	help

	The registry is used by Xenomai-based APIs to bind real-time
	objects they create to symbolic names, so that these objects
	can be further retrieved and shared by real-time applications
	regardless of their runtime space (i.e. kernel or user). Each
	named object occupies a registry slot.

	This option sets the maximum number of real-time objects the
	registry can handle. All APIs using the registry share this
	storage.

config XENO_OPT_SYS_HEAPSZ
	int "Size of the system heap (Kb)"
	default 256
	help

	The system heap is used for various internal allocations by
	the nucleus and the real-time APIs. The size is expressed in
	Kilobytes.

config XENO_OPT_SYS_STACKPOOLSZ
        depends on XENO_GENERIC_STACKPOOL
	int "Size of the private stack pool (Kb)"
	default 128
	help

	On this architecture, kernel-based Xenomai threads get the
	stack space they need from a private memory pool.  If you
	don't start any kernel-based thread (i.e. no RTDM driver
	thread, no real-time task created from an application embodied
	into a kernel module, no switchtest driver), you may leave a
	zero value for this option. The size is expressed in Kilobytes.

	help

	Xenomai implementation of user-space semaphores relies on heaps 
	shared between kernel and user-space. This configuration entry
	allow to set the size of the heap used for private semaphores.

	Note that each semaphore will allocate 4 bytes on 32 bits 
	architectures or 8 bytes on 64 bits architectures of memory, so,
	the default of 12 Kb allows creating many semaphores.

config XENO_OPT_GLOBAL_SEM_HEAPSZ
	int "Size of global semaphores heap (Kb)"
	default 12
	help

	Xenomai implementation of user-space semaphores relies on heaps 
	shared between kernel and user-space. This configuration entry
	allow to set the size of the heap used for semaphores shared 
	between several processes.

	Note that each semaphore will allocate 4 bytes on 32 bits 
	architectures or 8 bytes on 64 bits architectures of memory, so,
	the default of 12 Kb allows creating many semaphores.

menuconfig XENO_OPT_DEBUG
        depends on XENO_OPT_VFILE
	bool "Debug support"
	help

	When enabled, various debugging features can be switched
	on. They can help to find problems in applications, drivers,
	and the Xenomai core. XENO_OPT_DEBUG by itself does not have
	any impact on generated code.

if XENO_OPT_DEBUG

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_NUCLEUS
	bool "Nucleus runtime checks"
	help

	This option activates various debugging checks inside the core
	system. Doing so adds a significant runtime overhead,
	worsening the latency figures especially on SMP kernels.  Do
	not switch this option on unless you really know what you are
	doing.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_XNLOCK
	bool "Spinlocks monitoring"
	default y if SMP
	help

	This option activates measurements of Xenomai spinlocks
	spinning time and duration. It should have a low overhad, and
	helps finding latency spots due to masking
	sections. Statistics about the longest masking section may be
	found in /proc/xenomai/lock.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_QUEUES
	bool "Queue sanity checks"
	help

	This option turns on debugging checks in all linked-list
	manipulation routines inside the Xenomai core. This adds HUGE
	runtime OVERHEAD, use with CARE.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_REGISTRY
	bool "Registry monitoring"
	help

	This option activates debugging output for key registry
	operations performed by the Xenomai core. This option is
	useful to detect the source of object naming conflicts.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TIMERS
	bool "Timer monitoring"
	help

	This option activates debugging output for critical
	timer-related operations performed by the Xenomai core.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_SYNCH_RELAX
	bool "Detect mutexes held in relaxed sections"
	help

	This option detects situations where a real-time thread
	attempts to sleep on a Xenomai mutex object, that is owned by
	another thread currently running in secondary mode (i.e. plain
	Linux execution mode). The SIGDEBUG signal may be sent in such
	a case to the sleeper, provided the WARNSW flag is enabled for
	it, as set by e.g. rt_task_set_mode() or pthread_set_mode_np().

	This particular situation is a possible source of unwanted
	latency, since the current mutex owner may be unexpectedly
	delayed as a result of using non-deterministic Linux services,
	thus deferring the release of the mutex object for too long.

	This option may introduce some overhead in case mutexes are
	highly contended. Use this feature for debugging purposes
	only.

	NOTE: only Xenomai synchronization objects that may be
	actually "owned" by a single thread at a time, can be
	monitored this way (typically, mutexes).

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TRACE_RELAX
	bool "Trace relax requests"
	help

	This option enables recording of unwanted relax requests from
	user-space applications leaving the real-time domain, logging
	the thread information and code location involved. All records
	are readable from /proc/xenomai/debug/relaxes, and can be
	decoded using the "slackspot" utility.

config XENO_OPT_WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog support"
	default y
	help

	This option activates a watchdog aimed at detecting runaway
	real-time threads. If enabled, the watchdog triggers after
	a given period of uninterrupted real-time activity has elapsed
	without Linux interaction in the meantime; in such event, the
	current real-time thread is killed. The built-in watchdog
	support operates on behalf of the timer tick handler,
	thus is only active after the timer has been started. The
	timeout value of the watchdog can be set using the
	XENO_OPT_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT parameter.

config XENO_OPT_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT
	depends on XENO_OPT_WATCHDOG
	int "Watchdog timeout"
	default 4
	range 1 60
	help

	Watchdog timeout value (in seconds).

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_POSIX
	bool "POSIX cleanup checks"
	default n
	help

	When enabled, this option makes the skin warn about not
	properly cleaned up POSIX objects it detects on process
	termination.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM
	bool "RTDM debugging checks"
	default y
	help

	This option activates debugging checks for the RTDM subsystem.
	It is a recommended option for analysing potential issues in
	RTDM drivers. A minor runtime overhead is added.

config XENO_OPT_DEBUG_RTDM_APPL
	bool "RTDM application cleanup checks"
	default y
	help

	When enabled, this option makes RTDM warn about auto-clean
	operations executed upon application termination.
