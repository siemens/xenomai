<a name="porting-rtos"></a>1.2. Porting traditional RTOS-based applications to GNU/Linux</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The idea of using GNU/Linux as an embedded system
      with real-time capabilities is not novel. The reader can refer
      to Jerry Epplin's article in the October 97 issue of Embedded
      Systems Programming for a discussion about GNU/Linux potential
      in the embedded field [2].</p>
<p>Throughout this document, we will use the expression
      <span class="emphasis"><em>source RTOS</em></span> to indicate the traditional
      real-time operating from which the application is to be ported,
      and <span class="emphasis"><em>target OS</em></span> to indicate GNU/Linux or any
      other free operating system to which the application could be
      ported.</p>

<a name="highlevel-code"></a>1.2.1. <span class="level3">Limited high-level code modification</span></h4></div></div></div>
<p>Keeping the initial design and implementation of a hard
	real-time application when attempting to port it to another
	architecture is obviously of the greatest
	interest. Reliability and performance may have been obtained
	after a long, complex and costly engineering process one does
	not want to compromise. Consequently, the best situation is to
	have the closest possible equivalence between the source and
	destination RTOS programming interfaces, as far as both the
	syntax and the semantics are concerned.</p>
<p>An illustration of this can be taken from the support of
	a priority inheritance protocol [3] by the mutual exclusion
	services. These services allow concurrent threads to protect
	themselves from race conditions that could occur into critical
	sections of code. The purpose of this discussion is not to
	argue whether relying on priority inheritance for resolving
	priority inversion problems is a major design flaw or a
	necessary safety belt for a real-time application, but only to
	emphasize that any cases, if this feature is used in the
	source RTOS, but not available from the target OS, the
	resource management strategy must be reevaluated for the
	application, since priority inversion risks will
	exists.</p>

<a name="rtos-compat"></a>1.2.2. RTOS behavioural compatibility</h4></div></div></div>
<p>During the past years, major embedded RTOS, such as
	VRTX, VxWorks, pSOS+ and a few others, have implemented a
	real-time kernel behaviour which has become a de facto
	standard, notably for thread scheduling, inter-thread
	synchronization, and asynchronous event management. To
	illustrate this, let us talk about a specific concern in the
	interrupt service management.</p>
<p>A well-known behaviour of such RTOS is to lock the
	rescheduling procedure until the outer interrupt service
	routine (or ISR) - called first upon possibly nested
	interrupts - has exited, after which a global rescheduling is
	finally stated. This way, an interrupt service routine
	can always assume that no synchronous thread activity may run
	until it has exited. Moreover, all changes impacting the
	scheduling order of threads, due to actions taken by any
	number of nested ISRs (e.g. signaling a synchronization object
	on which one or more threads are pending) are considered once
	and conjunctively, instead of disjunctively.</p>
<p>For instance, if a suspended thread is first resumed by
	an ISR, then forcibly suspended later by another part of the
	same ISR, the outcome will be that the thread will not run,
	and remain suspended after the ISR has exited. In the other
	hand, if the RTOS sees ISRs as non-specific code that can be
	preempted by threads, the considered thread will be given the
	opportunity to execute immediately after it is resumed, until
	it is suspended anew. Obviously, the respective resulting
	situations won't be identical.</p>

<a name="reevalutation"></a>1.2.3. Reevaluation of the real-time constraints</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Making GNU/Linux a hard real-time system is currently
	achieved by using a co-kernel approach which takes control of
	the hardware interrupt management, and allows running
	real-time tasks seamlessly aside of the hosting GNU/Linux
	system [4]. The 'regular' Linux kernel is eventually seen as a
	low-priority, background of the small real-time executive. The
	<a href="http://www.rtlinux.org" target="_top">RTLinux</a> project
	is representative of this technical path. However, this
	approach has a major drawback when it comes to port complex
	applications from a foreign software platform: since the
	real-time tasks run outside the Linux kernel control, the
	GNU/Linux programming model cannot be preserved when porting
	these applications. The result is an increased complexity in
	redesigning and debugging the ported code.</p>
<p>In some cases, choosing a traditional RTOS to run an
	embedded application has been initially dictated by the memory
	constraints imposed by the target hardware, instead of actual
	real-time constraints imposed by the application itself. Since
	embedded devices tend to exhibit ever increasing memory and
	processing horsepower, it seems judicious to reevaluate the
	need for real-time guarantee when considering the porting
	effort to GNU/Linux on a new target hardware. This way, the
	best underlying software architecture can be selected. In this
	respect, the following, the following criteria need to be
	considered:

	</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Determinism and
	      criticality.</em></span></p>
<p>What is the worst
	      case interrupt and dispatch latencies needed
	      ?</p>
<p>Does a missed deadline lead to a
	      catastrophic failure ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Programming model</em></span></p>
<p>What is the overall application complexity,
	      provided that the higher the complexity, the greater
	      the need for powerful debugging aid and monitoring
	      tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a need need for low-level hardware
	      control ? </p>
<p>Is the real-time activity
	      coupled to non real-time services, such as GUI or
	      databases, requiring sophisticated communications with
	      the non real-time world ?</p>
</li>

<a name="existing-solutions"></a>1.2.4. Some existing solutions</h4></div></div></div>
<p>In order to get whether hard or soft real-time support,
	several GNU/Linux-based solutions exist [5][6]. It is not the
	purpose of this paper to present them all exhaustively. We
	will only consider a two fold approach based on free software
	solutions which is likely to be suited for many porting
	taskings, depending on the actual real-time constraints
	imposed by the application.</p>

<a name="partial-rewriting"></a>1.2.4.1. Partial rewriting using a real-time GNU/Linux
	  extension</h5></div></div></div>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Real-time enabling GNU/Linux using
	  RTAI.</em></span> Strictly speaking Linux/RTAI [7] is not a
	  real-time operating system but rather a real-time Linux
	  kernel extension, which allows running real-time tasks
	  seamlessly aside of the hosting GNU/Linux system. The RTAI
	  co-kernel shares hardware interrupts and system-originated
	  events like traps and faults with the Linux kernel using the
	  <a href="http://www.adeos.org/" target="_top">Adeos</a>
	  virtualization layer, which in turn ensures RTAI low
	  interrupt latencies. The native RTAI API provides the
	  applications a wealth of useful services, including counting
	  semaphores, POSIX 1003.1-1996 facilities such as pthreads,
	  mutexes and condition variables, also adding remote
	  procedure call facility, mailboxes, and precision
	  timers. Most services are symmetrically available from
	  kernel module and user-space programs.</p>
<p>RTAI 2.x and 3.x provide a means to execute hard
	  real-time tasks in user-space context (x86 only), but still
	  outside the Linux kernel control, which is best described as
	  running 'user-space kernel modules'. This feature, namely
	  LXRT, is a major step toward a simpler migration path from
	  traditional RTOS, since programming errors occuring within
	  real-time tasks don't jeopardize the overall GNU/Linux
	  system sanity, at the expense of a few microseconds more
	  latency.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Ad hoc services emulation.</em></span> A first
	  approach consists in emulating each real-time facility
	  needed by the application using a combination of the RTAI
	  services. An ad hoc wrapping interface has to be written to
	  support the needed function calls. The benefit of the
	  wrapping approach lies in the limited modifications made to
	  the original code. However, some RTAI behaviours may not be
	  compliant with the source operating system's. For the very
	  same reason, conflicts between the emulated and native RTAI
	  services may occur in some way.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Complete port to RTAI.</em></span> A second
	  approach consists in fully porting the application over the
	  native RTAI API. In such a case, RTAI facilities are
	  globally substituted from the facilities from the source
	  RTOS. This solution brings improved consistency at the
	  expense of a possible large-scale rewriting of the
	  application, due to some fundamental behavioural differences
	  that may exist between the traditional RTOS and the native
	  RTAI interface.</p>

<a name="uspace-emul"></a>1.2.4.2. Unconstrained user-space emulations</h5></div></div></div>
<p>A few traditional RTOS emulators exists in the free
	  software world. There are generally designed on top of the
	  GNU/Linux POSIX 1003.1-1996 layer, and allow to emulate the
	  source RTOS API in a user-space execution context, under the
	  control of the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Once one of the most proeminent effort in this area
	  used to be the Legacy2linux project [8]. This project,
	  sponsored by Montavista Software, aimed at providing
	  [<span class="citation">"a series of Linux-resident emulators for various
	  legacy RTOS kernels."</span>] Just like Xenomai,
	  [<span class="citation">these emulators are designed to ease the task of
	  porting legacy RTOS code to an embedded Linux
	  environment".</span>] Two emulators have been made
	  available by this project, respectively mimicking the APIs
	  of WindRiver's pSOS+ and VxWorks real-time operating
	  systems. However, this project has stalled due to a lack of
	  maintenance and contribution. </p>
<p>The benefits of this approach is mainly to keep the
	  development process in the GNU/Linux user-space environment,
	  instead of moving to a rather 'hostile' kernel/supervisor
	  mode context. This way, the rich set of existing tools such
	  as debuggers, code profilers, and monitors usable in this
	  context are immediatly available to the application
	  developer. Moreover, the standard GNU/Linux programming
	  model is preserved, allowing the application to use the full
	  set of of facilities existing in the user space (e.g. full
	  POSIX support, including inter-process communication). Last
	  but not least, programming errors occuring in this context
	  don't jeopardize the overall GNU/Linux system stability,
	  unlike what can happen if a bug is encountered on behalf of
	  a hard real-time RTAI task which could cause serious damages
	  to the running Linux kernel.
	  </p>
<p>However, we can see at least three problems in using
	  these emulators, depending on the application constraints:
	  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>First, the emulated API they provide is usually
		incomplete for an easy port from the source RTOS. In
		other words, only a limited syntactic compatibility is
		available.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, the exact behaviour of the source RTOS is
		not reproduced for all the functional areas. In other
		words, the semantic compatibility might not be
		guaranteed.</p></li>
<li><p>These emulators don't share any common code base
		for implementing the fundamental real-time behaviours,
		even so both pSOS+ and VxWorks share most of them. The
		resulting situation leads to redundant implementation
		efforts, without any benefit one can see in code
		mutualization.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, even combined to the latest Linux
		2.6 features like fine-grain kernel preemption and low
		latency efforts, these emulators cannot deliver
		deterministic real-time performance.</p></li>
