.SH NAME
xeno\-test \- Tests and measures the performance of a Xenomai installation

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxeno\-test\fP measures the performance of Xenomai, by executing Xenomai's \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP tests while generating a high workload on the system.
The default command that is executed to simulate workload (if no alternate command is specified with a \fB-W\fP \fIcommand\fP option) is:
.RS
.sp
.B dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null
.sp
.RE
The executed \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP tests periodically (every second) sample and print out the minimum, average, and maximum latency.
However, by default, if no option is specified to \fBxeno\-test\fP, those tests are executed with the \fB\-q\fP option (see below), which disables the printing of samples.
If the \fB\-q\fP option is not specified, samples are printed in groups separated by headers.
In addition, \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP print statistics for all samples before terminating, and can also optionally print statistics for every group of samples (see the \fB\-s\fP option), and distribution histograms (see the \fB\-h\fP option).

If an invalid option is specified, \fBxeno\-test\fP prints out an usage help message and exits.

You are strongly encouraged to use the \fB\-m\fP option, to anonymously help the Xenomai team collecting statistics about Xenomai's performance on the widest range of systems.

.SH OPTIONS
These following options are specific to \fBxeno\-test\fP:
.TP
\fB\-w\fP \fIworkloads\fP
The number of workload commands to execute simultaneously. By default, this number is \fB1\fP.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIdevice\fP
If the default workload command is to be executed, sets the input device to be read by \fBdd\fP to \fIdevice\fP instead of \fB/dev/zero\fP.
For instance, specifying the device of a real hard-drive (e.g. \fB/dev/hda/\fP) is useful for generating interrupts with I/O.
The specified \fIdevice\fP must be mounted, and cannot be an NFS mount.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP \fIcommand\fP
Executes the specified \fIcommand\fP to generate workload, instead of the default \fBdd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null\fP command.

If the command requires arguments, the command and its arguments must be quoted and passed as a single \fIcommand\fP argument.
In addition to such static arguments, the \fIargs\fP optional arguments passed to \fBxeno\-test\fP are appended to \fIcommand\fP to execute it. 
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIcommand\fP
Makes \fBxeno\-test\fP execute the specified \fIcommand\fP before, between and after the \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP tests.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
Activates logging. The log file is created in the current directory, and is named \fBtest\-\fP\fIkernel_release\fP, where \fIkernel_release\fP is the release number of the running Linux kernel (as determined by executing \fBuname \-r\fP).
.TP
\fB\-N\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prepends \fIprefix\fP\fB\-\fP to the log file name, hence if the \fB\-L\fP option is also specified the log file name is \fIprefix\fP\fB\-test\-\fP\fIkernel_release\fP.
This option is useful to create the log file in a different directory, by specifying a \fIprefix\fP that starts with the relative path to that directory.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Sends the results of the tests to the Xenomai team's email address, to help collecting statistics about Xenomai's performance. The email is sent using the system's mail(1) command.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP \fIemail\fP
Sends the results of the tests to the specified email address. The email is sent using the system's mail(1) command.
.PP
The following options are directly passed to the \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP test commands executed by \fBxeno\-test\fP.
If no such options are specified, the \fB\-s \-T 10 \-q\fP options are passed by default by \fBxeno\-test\fP.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Displays statistics (minimum, average, and maximum latencies) for every group of samples.
The number of samples in each group is determined by the \fB\-l\fP \fIsamples\fP option (default is \fB21\fP samples).
.TP
\fB\-l\fP \fIsamples\fP
The number of samples in every group of samples.
This number is the number of sample lines displayed between every header line, and is the number of samples used to calculate intermediate statistics if the \fB\-s\fP option is specified.
By default, this number is \fB21\fP.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Displays histograms of all sampled data, at the end of tests.
The number of categories - or value intervals - of each histogram is determined by the \fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP option (default is \fB100\fP categories).
The granularity - or bucket size -, used to separate latency samples into categories, is determined by the \fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP option (default is \fB1000\fP ns).
.TP
\fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP
The number of categories - or value intervals - of histograms to display if the \fB\-h\fP option is specified.
By default, this number is \fB100\fP. 
.TP
\fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP
The granularity - or bucket size -, in nanoseconds, used to discriminate between the categories of latency samples in histograms (to be printed if the \fB\-h\fP option is specified).
By default, this number is \fB1000\fP ns.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP \fIseconds\fP
The period, in seconds, during which \fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP tests are respectively executed.
If that option is not specified, the tests execute infinitely until the user types \fBCONTROL-C\fP (i.e. sends a SIGINT signal to them).
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Disables the printing of samples and sample group statistics (hence this overrides the \fB\-s\fP option), and only global statistics and histograms are being printed.
The default behaviour, if this option is not specified, is to display every sample (measured minimum, average, and maximum latency) and optionally sample group statistics (if \fB\-s\fP is specified).
.TP
.B \-\-
Indicates the end of options.
This must be specified before \fIargs\fP arguments if the first argument starts with \fB\-\fP, so that it is not considered as an option.
.PP
.SH "RETURN CODES"
.TP
.B 0
The tests executed successfully.
.TP
.B 1
An invalid option was specified.
.SH KNOWN BUGS
\fBxeno\-test\fP allows to specify the \fB\-N\fP \fIlogprefix\fP option without the \fB\-L\fP option, in which case the log file name is: \fIlogprefix\fP\fB\-\fP.

\fBlatency\fP and \fBklatency\fP allow to specify the \fB\-H\fP \fIcategories\fP and \fB\-B\fP \fIgranularity\fP options without the \fB\-h\fP option, in which case they have no effect.

It is not possible to specify the period between samples (default is \fB1 second\fP) since this is not configurable for \fBklatency\fP, although this may be configured for \fBlatency\fP through this command's \fB\-p\fP option.
