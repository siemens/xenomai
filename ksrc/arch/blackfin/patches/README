-- arch/blackfin/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

On the Blackfin architecture, Xenomai is supported on the BF527,
BF533, BF537, BF548 and BF561(*) boards, either based on the uClinux
releases published by the Blackfin project [2], or based on its
development tree [3].

Just apply the provided patch against the corresponding kernel
release/milestone. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL
guides at the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.
