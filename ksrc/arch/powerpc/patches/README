-- arch/powerpc/patches

Xenomai needs special kernel support to deliver fast and deterministic
response time to external interrupts, and also to provide real-time
services highly integrated with the standard Linux kernel.

This support is provided by the Adeos real-time enabler [1], in the
form of a kernel patch you have to apply against a vanilla kernel
tree, before you attempt to compile the Xenomai codebase against the
latter kernel.

On the PowerPC 32bit architecture, Xenomai is supported on both the
v2.4 and v2.6 Linux kernel series, for which the appropriate Adeos
patches exist. The v2.4 kernel tree of reference for Xenomai/PowerPC
is available from Denx's public CVS tree as the "linuxppc_2_4_devel"
branch [2]. For the v2.6 series, Adeos patches are based on releases
from kernel.org, the, validated against Denx's public git repository
[3] as well.

As of 2.6.20, Adeos patches are based on the powerpc/ tree, instead of
the deprecated ppc/ tree.

Just apply one of those patches against the corresponding kernel
release. You may want to have a look at the README.*INSTALL guides at
the top of the Xenomai tree for more information.
